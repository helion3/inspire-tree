# Changes to Inspire Tree

# 7.0.11

- Fixed `itree.parent` being lost on tree node clone.

# 7.0.10

- Additional fixes for recursive keys, and fixed recursion test oversight.

# 7.0.9

- Made `TreeNode#context` and `itree#parent` fields unenumerable to prevent recursion errors from libraries that deeply iterate object properties.

# 7.0.8

- Fixed `selectFirstAvailableNode` to look deeply.

# 7.0.7

- Fixed `selectFirstAvailableNode` trying to select unselectable nodes.

# 7.0.6

- Fixed typo in method type.

# 7.0.5

- Fixed careless mistake placing `unshiftChild` method on the wrong interface.

# 7.0.4

- Added missed type definition for `unshiftChild`.

# 7.0.3

- Added `TreeNode.unshiftChild(child)`.

# 7.0.2

- Fixed inconsistent `TreeNode.tree` return.

# 7.0.1

- Added `cancelEditOnBlur` config.

# 7.0.0

- Clears `lastSelectedNode` if that node is deselected.
- Fixed `tree.splice` not mapping nodes `splice` correctly.
- Updated dependencies.

**Breaking Changes**

v7 drops `Promise` polyfills, so older browser without native Promise support are no longer supported.

v7 will be the LTS version pre-v8. It will effectively be maintenance work only.

# 7.0.0 Beta.9

- Added TreeNode#indexList for an array of context array indices.
- Reworked Tree#boundingNodes to fix issues with sorting.
- Fixed miscellaneous types.

# 7.0.0 Beta.8

- Fixed miscellaneous types.

# 7.0.0 Beta.7

- Fixed miscellaneous types.

# 7.0.0 Beta.6

- Fixed miscellaneous types.

# 7.0.0 Beta.5

- Fixed miscellaneous types.

# 7.0.0 Beta.4

- Fixed dist files never being updated in any 7.0.0 builds. I forgot to run `yarn deploy` first...

# 7.0.0 Beta.3

- Improved lodash imports.
- Added `node.contextmenu` event to type definitions.

# 7.0.0 Beta.2

- Improved node resolve type definitions.

# 7.0.0 Beta.1

Improvements to the typescript definition file:

- Added `TreeNode.hasLoadedChildren()`.
- Added `TreeNode.isOnlyRenderable()`.
- Added support for user-defined state properties on itree in `NodeConfig`.
- Fixed `TreeNode.children` definitions.

# 7.0.0 Beta.0

- Fixed typescript definitions for `data` config property.
- Added typescript entry for `TreeNode.children`.
- Dropped `Promise` polyfill (Internet Explorer support).
- Updated dependencies.

# 6.0.1

- Fixes copy not cloning exported object, sharing object references.

# 6.0.0

- Added `TreeNodes.first` and `TreeNodes.last` shallow search functions.
- Added `TreeNode.renderable`, `TreeNode.isFirstRenderable`, `TreeNode.isLastRenderable`, and `TreeNode.isOnlyRenderable` check functions.
- Moved batch/end/applyChanges to the TreeNodes level. Calling this on the tree as usual aliases the root-level model.
- Updated TreeNodes method to call batch/end on their context in most cases, not the entire tree.
- Added `TreeNodes.context()` as a parameter for `changes.applied` events. Some renderers could possibly ignore these if the context is a TreeNode.
- Added a config object argument to the TreeNodes constructor. Internally, calculateRenderablePositions is only used for "renderable" TreeNodes.
- Added pass-through of `includeState` parameter for `copy/copyHierarchy` methods which rely on `toObject`.
- Minor cleanup.

**Breaking Changes**

**Dirty**

Internally, first/last/only "renderable" nodes are calculated on add/remove or position change operations
(addNode, push, splice, sort, etc).

These are useful to rendering engines, and in order to communicate the change, nodes are marked as dirty
when their first/last/only position changes.

This will cause `dirty` flags to be *true* for some nodes when it wasn't previously.

**changes.applied**

Batching is now handled contextually. Each TreeNodes collection may fire its own `changes.applied` event. The event
now includes a `context` argument which will be the result of `TreeNodes.context()`. The context will either be
the InspireTree object, or a parent TreeNode.

If your entire tree is rendered on this event, you can either ignore the event when fired for a specific node, or
debounce it.


# 5.0.2

- Fixed incorrect `find` method typescript definition.
- Fixed minor spelling/linting errors.
- Fixed duplicate rerender call on model reset.

# 5.0.1

- Fixed parent checkbox not overriding indeterminate children.

# 5.0.0

- Added `TreeNode.assign`.
- Added `TreeNodes.find`.
- Added `TreeNodes.sortDeep`.
- Added state object argument support to `TreeNode.state`.
- Fixed argument support for `TreeNodes.invokeDeep`.
- Fixed typescript definition issues.
- Switched API doc generator from docdown to jsdoc.

**Breaking Changes**

- Removed `{ to() }` return of `copy` methods. For example `nodes.copy(dest)` instead of `nodes.copy().to(dest)`.

# 4.3.1

- Fixed crypto error resulting from build tool regression.

# 4.3.0

- Typescript definition file cleanup and improvements:
- Added `NodeConfig` interface.
- Imports `EventEmitter2` definitions.
- Various cleanup.

# 4.2.1

- Improves typescript definitions.
- Moves four npm dependencies to the `dependencies` array to support ES6 users.

# 4.2.0

- Added `includeState` parameter to `TreeNode.remove`.
- Added `draggable` and `drop-target` to node state objects.
- Improved logic for calculating pagination totals when using arrays.
- Fixed batch end error in `TreeNode.states`.

# 4.1.0

- Added `TreeNode.states` which sets multiple states to a single value.
- `toObject` now supports optionally exporting node state.
- Fixed pagination totals for nested data loaded via array.

# 4.0.1

- Added `TreeNode@hasAncestor`.

# 4.0.0

**Breaking Changes**

- Removes string typing of node ID.

This means that you must query your nodes by ID using the same type as the ID was given to the tree.
Using `id: 1` means you must query by a number, `tree.node(1)`. Previously, querying by a number *or* string
would work. This change allows your data to remain typed, if you need it later.

Anything except numbers or strings will still be converted to a string using `toString`.

# 3.0.1

- Added `TreeNode.hasOrWillHaveChildren`. Returns true when children are present or `children` property is true.

# 3.0.0

- Added `createNode` method for creating a node, without adding it.
- Added `TreeNode.tree` method.
- Implemented tests and support for inherited Array prototype methods (excluding those not available in IE10+).
- Updated typescript definition file to include Array methods.

**Breaking Changes**

- Removed `isNode` alias of `isTreeNode`.
- `isTreeNode` and `isTreeNodes` are now static methods.
- Renamed `filter` to `filterBy` to avoid overriding `Array.filter`.
- Renamed `sort` to `sortBy` to avoid overriding `Array.sort`.

# 2.0.6

- Added `isLoadEvent` boolean to state events. `true` only when event fires on load and is in `allowLoadEvents` config.

# 2.0.5

- Added `TreeNodes.move`.
- Added `TreeNodes.swap` and `TreeNode.swap`.
- Added event-related methods to typescript definition file.
- Fixed empty arrays not being converted to TreeNodes instances.
- Cached initial load promise on the tree rather than throwing its error.
- Added safety check for invalid arrays on data load.

# 2.0.4

- Clears existing data on `load` when not using deferred loading. Was broken with 1.11.

# 2.0.3

- Addressed incorrect version in distribution file banners.

# 2.0.2

- Added `TreeNode.reload` method.
- Removed bower support.

# 2.0.1

- Added `isTreeNode` alias to (and deprecated) `isNode`.
- Fixed uglify-incompatible instance checks.

# 2.0.0

2.0 is an overhaul (and improvement) with how we manage and build InspireTree. The API has *not* changed aside from some
additions, but *how you instantiate the DOM* **has**.

Most critically, the inspire-tree package is now only the core API. To use the official DOM renderer,
you'll also need the `inspire-tree-dom` package. This allows us to keep the packages cleaner for those
using their own view layer/rendering framework.

Overall, InspireTree is lighter because we now use rollup for bundling, which saves us 20k worth of code versus webpack.

We've ported our DOM rendering to [Inferno](https://infernojs.org/), and are seeing up to 60% faster rendering
(initial render of 10k nodes with Chrome 57 on macOS Sierra: 2265ms average with virtual-dom, 963ms average with Inferno).

- Added a gzipped copy of distribution files.
- Added `Tree.pagination`, `TreeNodes.pagination`, `TreNode.pagination`.
- Added/exposed `Tree.loadMore`, `TreeNodes.loadMore`, `TreNode.loadMore`, which loads additional paginated nodes.
- Fixed `check` call failing to reset indeterminate state.
- Overhauled and added tests for deferral-related pagination.
- Improved the efficiency of which uuid imports we're referencing.

**Breaking Changes**

- Moved DOM code into a new package, [inspire-tree-dom](https://github.com/helion3/inspire-tree-dom).
- Rewrote the DOM engine with Inferno, replacing virtual-dom.

While there are no official API changes, the `node.itree.ref.node` Element reference is now just `node.itree.ref`.

- We're no longer bundling lodash. If you're not using a bundler like Webpack, Browserify, or rollup,
you'll need to include it as a dependency.

- Removed native context menu support since the `node.contextmenu` event is passed through anyway.
- Renamed `node.paginate` event to `node.paginated`.
